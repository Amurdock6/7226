        <h3>CHILDREN LEARNING INDEPENDENTLY PROGRAM</h3>
        <p>Due to the isolation of children and families during this pandemic, Kids Read has launched a new program to take the books directly to the children.  
            It is called CLIP. We will provide appropriate level workbooks to each child. 
            These are the currently and traditionally used education workbooks and learning supplies they are used to.  
            The Library Ambassador with the help of the Kids Read Tutors will register and track the progress of children that live near the libraries.  
            They will meet with their family at the library for instruction and guidance.
        </p>
